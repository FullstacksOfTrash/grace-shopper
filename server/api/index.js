// used as a hub from which to bundle and export routes
// e.g., app.js might have middleware such as app.use('/api', api)
// and this file would bring all the separate route files together
// this is an example from my senior enrichment:const express = require('express')

// const router = express.Router()
// const schoolRoutes = require('./schoolRoutes')
// const studentRoutes = require('./studentRoutes')

// router.use('/schools', schoolRoutes)
// router.use('/students', studentRoutes)

// module.exports = router;
